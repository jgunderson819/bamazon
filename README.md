Bamazon homework
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront which utilizes MySQL and node.js. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

Bamazon Customer View
Running 'bamazonCustomer.js` will first display all of the items available for sale. This will include the ids, names, prices of products for sale and the stock quantity.

The app will then prompt users with two messages.

The first will ask for the ID of the product that they would like to buy.
The second message will ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
Once the customer has placed the order, the application will check if the store has sufficient product items to meet the customer's request.

If not, the app will log the phrase Insufficient quantity!, and prevent the order from going through.
The app will require npm inquirer and npm mysql.
